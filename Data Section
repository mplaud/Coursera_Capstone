In order to determine the best location for our client to open his Gym, we have extracted data on the Barrios 
from Ponce through the following link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Barrios_of_Ponce,_Puerto_Rico". 
Since there is no available table that includes the geocoordinates they have been manually retrieved from google maps. 
With this data on hand, Foursquare API was used to retrieve information on venues for each of the Barrios that were evaluated. 
Some Barrios did not have available venue information through Foursquare. These Barrios were filtered out for the purpose of the 
analysis. With the available data, k-means clustering was implemented on the Barrios in Ponce. The goal through this clustering 
was to evaluate the cluster where for some Barrios gym was among the 5th most common venues. Those Barrios that did not already 
have a venue for category gym would be viable options for the location of our client's business.
